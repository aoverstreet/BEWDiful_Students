For my final project, I wanted to build a simple CMS 
that would allow a person to Donate unused items. 

The CMS would include:
1) Create new user:
Name 
Password

2) Display items that you want to donate:
Name of item
Description of item
Display images of item(s)
Category: Electronic, Clothes, Furniture, Automobile or Misc.
Contact Information
Arrange for pickup -- Range (Day, Month, Year)

3) Email Confirmation for pick up:
Date -- Day, Month, Year 
Time
Confirmation Number

User Stories


Login Page
As a new user, you would create a profile, which would include email and password.
or have the ability to login via Devise (Facebook/omniauth).

Home page
After a successful login, Home page would appear. 
Welcome {user name} would appear along with 'Would you like to make new donation?'
and a list of past donations (which would include Name of item and Date).


Would you like to make new donation? (add button)
If the user clicks add button, user would be taken to a new donation page and 
a form would needed to filled out:

Name of item
Description of item
upload images of item(s)
Category: Electronic, Clothes, Furniture, Automobile or Misc.
Contact Information 
Arrange for pickup -- Range (Day, Month, Year)

If everything was successful (no error messages), redirect back to home page, with new 
item on top and edit button beside it.  The user will recieve an email with a confirmation number 
and soon after a follow up email with Date and time for pickup.


Past Donations 
If a user clicks on a past donation, it would redirect to an individual page.
Where it would list: 
Name of item
Description of item
Display images of item(s)
Category: Electronic, Clothes, Furniture, Automobile or Misc.
Date item was pickup 
Confirmation number

Click return to home page.


Edit Donation
If needed the user could edit donation.  The user would click edit and would be redirected to 
individual page.
