For my final project, I wanted to build a simple CMS that would allow a person to Donate unused items.  

The CMS would include:
1) Create new user:
Name 
Password

2) Display item(s) that you want to donate:
Name of item
Description of item
Display images of item(s)
Category: Electronic, Clothes, Furniture, Automobile or Misc.
Contact Information
Arrange for pickup -- Range (Day, Month, Year)

4) Email Confirmation to user for pick up:
Date -- Day, Month, Year  
Time
Confirmation Number
