Pipes And Redirection | (symbols)

$|$
The | takes the output from the command on the left, and "pipes" it to
the command on the right. In line 1 you see me do that.

$<$
The < will take and send the input from the file on the right to the
program on the left. You see me do that in line 2. This does not work in
PowerShell.

$>$
The > takes the output of the command on the left, then writes it to the
file on the right. You see me do that on line 9.

$>>$
The >> takes the output of the command on the left, then appends it to the file on the right.

* (asterisk) symbol to say "anything." Wherever you put the asterisk,
the shell will build a list of all the files that match the non-asterisk part.
